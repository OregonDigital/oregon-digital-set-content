    <p>Eugene Photographer John Bauguess documented downtown Eugene during a period of urban renewal in the 1970s. Of this work, Bauguess writes: &ldquo;When I photographed downtown Eugene in the Urban Renewal era of early 1970s, it was home to long-time residents and shop owners, as well as many artists who had rented vacated buildings for studios. When the buildings were torn down, most of the people were gone, never to return. Some did reappear, however, rediscovered three decades later in photographic prints I made from negatives retrieved from dusty boxes. Photographic memories of these people had aged like good wine.&rdquo;</p>
