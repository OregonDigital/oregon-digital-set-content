<p>The International Freshwater Treaties Collection (IFTC) is the world's largest compilation of agreements addressing surface and groundwater as a resource. The collection includes over 800 agreements covering the years from 1820 to 2020. Since its inception in 1997, both practitioners and academics in the global water community have used the ITFC in their work. It provides researchers with the ability to conduct large-n studies on the nature of transboundary water law, identify patterns in hydropolitics, and develop practical recommendations for water practitioners. In addition, practitioners directly use the collection to support their efforts in negotiating agreements and maintaining cooperative processes. Both English and non-English language agreements are included, when available.</p>
<p>The IFTC is part of the broader <a href="https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/data-and-datasets">Transboundary Freshwater Diplomacy Database</a> (TFDD), which is housed at Oregon State University. The database is available in a searchable and tabular format that is downloadable, available from the <a href="https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-freshwater-treaties-database">International Freshwater Treaties Database website</a>. Agreements in the database are coded by the basin and countries involved, date signed, treaty topic, allocation measures, conflict resolution mechanisms, non-water linkages, and many more issues. The update and maintenance of this collection and database would not be possible without the contributions of fellow researchers. If you have an agreement that is missing or should be included, please contact the <a href="https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/forms/contact-us">Program in Water Conflict Management and Transformation</a>.</p>
