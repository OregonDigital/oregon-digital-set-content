       <p>The  Tribal Legacies Project is an attempt to bring Native American history to the  center of Oregon and United States history. Native Americans have had a continuous  presence in what is now the state of Oregon for at least 15,000 years; sadly,  their deep and vital history often has been neglected, distorted, or relegated  to the margins. The Tribal Legacies Project identifies and documents primary  source collections in Special Collections and University Archives at the  University of Oregon Libraries, as well as other locations, that relate to American  Indians, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, and to their tribal histories. With  this project, as outlined in this catalog, we hope to increase awareness of and  make readily accessible the rich resources that tell their stories. What lies  to be discovered by scholars and students in these many collections is still  unknown, but surely these discoveries will contribute to new knowledge,  recognition, and understanding of Native American and United States history. </p>
         <p> Special Collections  and University Archives is the principal repository for the University of  Oregon&rsquo;s archives, rare books, historic photographs, and one of the largest historical manuscript  collections in the Pacific Northwest. It is the largest repository in the state  that provides extensive public access to its collections and is a critically  important reservoir of materials for research and instruction concerning Native  American history in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. Our holdings include over  17,000 linear feet of manuscripts; 19,000 linear feet of university archives;  100,000 monographs; 600,000 photographs and moving images; 5,000 architectural  drawings; 5,000 original drawings and illustrations; and over 20,000  broadsides, pamphlets, postage stamps, autographs, and pieces of ephemera. Included  in these original research materials are hundreds of documents that reflect the  tribal presence in Oregon. </p>
         <p> Our diverse collections support all  types of research, from K–12 education to international scholarship. We strive  to play an active and creative role in the teaching, research, and service  missions of the university. To that end, staff members in Special Collections  and University Archives acquire, assess, organize, and preserve primary source  documents—the raw stuff of history. For the Tribal Legacies Project, staff in  Special Collections and University Archives collaborated with Digital Library  Services and a team of Native students and graduate teaching fellows to survey  and assess our holdings related to Native Americans. Our purpose was to improve  access to tribal materials by creating an online resource and this catalog. Our  survey of primary source materials has a special emphasis on &ldquo;tribal legacies&rdquo; that  can be integrated with a curricular program.<br />
           Researchers and students will discover  that the manuscript, photograph, and archival collections at the University of  Oregon reveal the broad scope of the colonization efforts of Euro-Americans. These  collections comprise a wide range of original letters, reports, and treaty  records that document the colonization period, including documents of federal  officials appointed through the Office of Indian Affairs, later the Bureau of  Indian Affairs. </p>
         <p>Over ninety individual  collections related to Oregon tribes are housed in Special Collections and  University Archives, for example, individual handwritten letters, such as the  correspondence of appointed Oregon Territory Indian Agents; letters of American  settlers to family and friends; diaries of Oregon Trail travelers that mention  Native Americans; and records of army officials during the various &ldquo;Indian  Wars&rdquo; in the Northwest. Larger collections are the Klamath Tribal Council  Records, the extensive Lee Moorhouse photographs of Native American life in the  Columbia Basin and Umatilla County, and the Southwest Oregon Research Project  (SWORP), to name just a few. The SWORP Collection in particular showcases the  range of primary sources available on tribal history and culture. This  collection includes linguistic and ethnographic documents as well as political  records produced by the federal government concerning management of the western  tribes in Oregon. SWORP is one of the most frequently used collections in  Special Collections and University Archives.</p>
         <p>Many more related collections and  primary source materials are held in Special  Collections and University Archives, and some will be added  to the UO Libraries&rsquo; digital collections online. The Tribal Legacies Project is  an evolving process, as we discover together the rich history hidden in these  collections. We consider this project just the beginning of a strong  collaboration with the Oregon tribes as we work to add resources to the Tribal  Legacies Project and improve access to these collections.</p>
