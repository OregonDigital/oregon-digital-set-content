         <p>This  catalog represents collaboration between the University of Oregon’s College of  Education and the University of Oregon Libraries to address the needs of Oregon’s  nine federally recognized tribes. It addresses the need to create a trusted central  repository of historical tribal documents as well as current curriculum  materials related to Indian history and culture.<strong> </strong></p>
         <p>The  catalog is a living document highlighting resources in the UO Libraries that will  serve as a focal point for ongoing teaching, learning, and research related to  the Native American experience for UO students and faculty as well as tribal  staff, students, and scholars. Its primary objective is to improve the visibility  and accessibility of these rich resources while conveying the university’s  strong commitment to preserving the all-inclusive historical record of the  Pacific Northwest and integrating it into the curriculum of both K-12 and  higher education.</p>
         <p>The  UO Libraries has built a strong relationship with many of the regional tribes,  beginning with an extensive project to archive important tribal documents during  the 1990s. In May 1997, leaders of coastal Oregon tribes gathered for the first  time in more than a century for a potlatch ceremony on the UO campus. During  the ceremony, leaders of the Coquille tribe, in conjunction with the UO  Libraries and Graduate School, presented to the tribes of Southwest Oregon  copies of some 60,000 pages of documents on tribal history and culture. Organized  and preserved as part of the Southwest Oregon Research Project (SWORP), the  documents had previously been widely  scattered and scarcely noticed as original documents pertaining to the history  of the Native peoples of greater Oregon. </p>
         <p>Another  groundbreaking potlatch in June 2001 brought together representatives of 44 western  Indian tribes for the first time in at least 150 years to celebrate the  presentation of an additional 50,000 pages of archival material that SWORP  researchers had recovered. In addition to the copies presented to the  individual tribes, the UO Libraries holds a complete set in Special Collections  and University Archives, where it is actively used by undergraduates and other  researchers. Although this seems like an enormous amount of material, it scarcely  scratches the surface of what is held in various regional archives and private  collections. </p>
         <p>The  UO Libraries has also built a strong relationship with the Confederated Tribes  of the Umatilla through a project called Picturing the Cayuse, Walla Walla, and  Umatilla Tribes (<a href="http://oregondigital.org/digcol/mh">http://oregondigital.org/digcol/mh</a>). This digital  collection of historical images was assembled from the Moorhouse photograph  collection, with material selected and described by tribal members. The library  also is working with the Klamath tribes to provide copies of documents lost  from tribal records during the period between the termination of tribal  recognition in 1954 and its restoration 32 years later in 1986. </p>
         <p>These  projects have created an important foundation for this catalog and future  endeavors that honor tribal legacies. They represent both the potential of such  a central repository and the beginning of a relationship between Oregon tribes  and the university built on the principles of tribal self-determination, tribal  consultation, and equal partnership.</p>
         <p>The  catalog provides growing evidence that important goals of the UO Libraries strategic  directions are being achieved by attending to the needs of tribal communities.  The first of these goals relates to improving the campus climate for diversity  by diversifying the library’s holdings and broadening access to library  materials. The project also helps the library create barrier-free access to its  collections by enhancing both the intellectual and physical accessibility for  all communities, not just university faculty, students, and staff.<strong></strong></p>
         <p>Currently,  access to many important tribal archives is challenging. The resources are  dispersed and can be difficult to locate. The tribes  spend considerable amounts of time and money sending individuals to study at  remote sites or to make copies and bring back to the community. This catalog  will make it possible for tribal members, students, and researchers to have information  about materials relating to Native peoples at their fingertips and to do useful  and meaningful research projects and papers. This catalog and future  initiatives will also provide the opportunity for tribal archivists and UO  archivists to cross-train and work hand in hand on making this a dynamic living  repository.</p>
         <p>Additionally, the project addresses  points, goals, and actions within the UO College of Education’s (COE) Strategic  Action Plan, particularly  in developing and strengthening community  linkages. Meaningful connections between the COE and tribal communities  is paramount to complete the COE mission of preparing teachers, social service  providers, and educational leaders to work in schools and social service  systems serving Native people. The goal to cultivate sustainable relationships  with tribal communities is an area of utmost concern and offers tremendous opportunities  for reciprocal teaching and learning where the university, as an institution,  can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of Native people locally,  regionally, and nationally.</p>
         <p>These collaborations, projects, and catalog serve many  purposes. They represent an effort at the University of Oregon to develop a culturally  responsive community by contributing to our knowledge of dispersed collections  and responding to access and preservation requirements. They improve the campus  climate by encouraging more tribal people to visit campus and by supporting  more instruction related to Native themes. They help attract more students and  faculty of Indian heritage to the UO. They develop and strengthen community  linkages by demonstrating a commitment to collaboration, partnership, and service  to our tribal nations and other communities of color. Finally, they develop and  reinforce diversity infrastructure by creating a statewide resource and laying  the foundation for focused curriculum development in areas such as Native  Studies.</p>
