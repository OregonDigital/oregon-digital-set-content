	<p>The African Political Ephemera and Realia Project is an online collection of ephemeral material - pamphlets, t-shirts, cloths, posters, to name just a few examples - that documents the material culture of politics in Sub-Saharan Africa. Ephemeral political material often does not find its way into institutional collections either because the material is discarded before it draws the attention of collectors, because it is too popular and mass-produced to merit consideration as art, or because it does not fit easily (either physically or intellectually) into the book- and manuscript-based realm of libraries. The African Political Ephemera Project hopes to focus attention on the significance of ephemeral political material as cultural artifacts that document both the political processes and the social and cultural forces at work in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
	<p>The Africa Political Ephemera and Realia Project is a collaboration between the <a href="http://africa.uoregon.edu/">African Studies Program</a> and the <a href="http://libweb.uoregon.edu/">UO Libraries</a>.</p>

      The University of Oregon Libraries present here a selection of images from the collections of
      printed sheet music held by the <a href="http://libweb.uoregon.edu/music/">Music Services Department</a> and in the
      Oregon Collection of <a href="http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/">Special Collections &amp; University Archives</a>
      at the University of Oregon Libraries. <a href="?search_field=all_fields">Browse the entire collection.</a>

      The preliminary digitized music collections currently available are the
	  <a href="<%= "/sets/#{params[:set]}/about#oregon" %>">Oregon Music Collection</a>, focusing on music by Oregonians or about Oregon events and
	  places, and the <a href="<%= "/sets/#{params[:set]}/about#women" %>">Women Composers Collection</a>, showing the strength of the collection in
      music by women composers. These collections mirror the larger collections of the Music Services Department and
      provide a glimpse into the riches and possibilities of research available in the Historic Sheet Music Collection.
