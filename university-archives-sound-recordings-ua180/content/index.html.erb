<p>The UO Libraries Special Collections & University Archives contains historical sound recordings—cylinders, discs, wires, and tapes—that document the history of the university and of individuals and organizations documented in its special collections. Many of these recordings are unique, and as primary source materials offer different perspectives on the historical record. All historical sound recordings are at risk of loss due to the threats of technological obsolescence and material degradation. This digital collection contains sound recordings digitized by the UO Libraries for preservation and access.</p>
