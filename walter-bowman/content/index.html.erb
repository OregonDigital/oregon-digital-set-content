    Walter S. Bowman (1865-1938) was a professional photographer who worked in Pendleton, Oregon, from the late 1880s to the mid 1930s. Bowman's photographs document daily life in Eastern Oregon, including special events such as the Pendleton Roundup.
  </p>
<p>The Bowman collection was donated to the Library over a period of years spanning 1947-1953. The collection was donated through the efforts of Judge James H. Sturgis and Lee D. Drake of Pendleton, a newspaperman, county clerk, and collector of historic materials.
