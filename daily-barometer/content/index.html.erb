<p><em>The Daily Barometer</em> is Oregon State University's student-published campus newspaper. The content is written and edited by Oregon State students and includes news articles, editorials, and advertisements. This publication documents the full range of campus programs and activities including academic and research initiatives, student activities, athletics, campus buildings and facilities, as well as local and regional news and events.</p>

<p>The first issue was published on March 16, 1896 as <em>The College Barometer</em>; publication continued monthly until 1907 in a magazine format. In the fall of 1907, <em>The College Barometer</em> became a weekly publication in a newspaper format; semi-weekly publication began in December 1909. A daily newspaper was launched in 1923 and the title changed to <em>The Daily Barometer</em> to reflect this expanded publication. In 2016, the campus newspaper reduced print publication to a weekly, <em>The Baro</em>, and delivered daily news online through the Orange Media Network website.</p>

<p>A long-term project currently being conducted by the Special Collections and Archives Research Center's Digital Production Unit seeks to digitize all issues of the campus newspaper. Comprehensive digitization began in 2020 and will continue until completed; issues are added to this site regularly. When possible, paper copies of the newspaper will be digitized; when this is not possible, the digital version will be made from microfilm of the newspaper.</p>
