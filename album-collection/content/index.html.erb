    <p>The Album collection contains approximately 50 albums from many separate donations. The albums themselves were created by individuals during the different time periods of each album. Highlights of this collection include albums of early Sutherlin, Oregon; construction of the Westover Terrace in Portland, Oregon; construction of the Bonneville dam on the Columbia River; and views of early (late 1800&rsquo;s) London and Peking.</p>
